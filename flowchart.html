                <h3>Computational thinking in practice</h3>
                    <p>Computational thinking cannot be limited to programming and coding. It encompasses many other professional sectors and everyday activities. 
                      For instance, moving into a new city/country as a student can be daunting and to top it, cooking for yourself is now a new responsibility</p>
                      <br>
                    <p>Your initial concern would be to go grocery shopping. The first step is to find grocery stores by doing a search online. Sort the best ones (location/proximity) plus the ones with student discounts (pattern recognition). Using this knowledge, select a single store. Go on google maps and follow the directions. (problem decomposition)</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>At the store, notice all the relevant information, such as the different aisles for various food products you need (meat/vegetables/ fruits/ cereals/ bread ), the billing counter, and the check-out door. (abstraction) By forming a detailed step-by-step procedure, the task of grocery shopping is completed successfully. (algorithm)</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Thinking computationally is an approach to breaking down and completing tasks in a detailed manner.
                        <br>Further down the career road, this skill stands out from the rest because it develops logical reasoning and debugging.
